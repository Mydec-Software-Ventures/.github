# Mydec Software Ventures

Mydec Software Ventures is a venture founded by [Robert Myers](https://github.com/rablj5) and [P. Todd Decker](https://github.com/ptdecker). Currently, we're focused on developing a set of projects designed to improve our collective coding skills. Beyond that, we're also exploring an experimental roleplaying game engine with LLM support for semi-autonomous NPCs and a state-driven game engine. [Jason Jurusz](https://github.com/NerdyDeedsLLC) and [Joel Teply](https://github.com/joelteply) are also onboard the train working with Todd on [DnDPT](https://github.com/Mydec-Software-Ventures/dndpt).

The code is not public, but currently we have one major project underway:

* [Mydec Chess](https://github.com/Mydec-Software-Ventures/mydec-chess) - A C#-based project to develop a player-vs-player chess game.
* [DnDPT](https://github.com/Mydec-Software-Ventures/dndpt) - A place to work on an experimental LLM-driven NPC with a state-machine based game engine role playing game.
* [Tutorials](https://github.com/Mydec-Software-Ventures/Tutorials) - Parking lot for small tutorials and examples
